TODO

- generate master code and show it
- later, will only show if state == solved
- then add functionlity to add new guess visually
- then logic to check guess
- then ui updates for solved state
- add error boundary

* could add high scores screen later (async storage)
* could add difficulty setting screen later (maybe try context?)
* should change score boxes to children of row in parent component instead of using if in pegbox
